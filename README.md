# Web app from scratch


### Pro's and Con's of jQuery (libraries/frameworks in general)

#### Pro's
- Your can do more work in less hours.
- Tested by many and mostly supported by a community.
- Most of the frameworks are free.

#### Con's
- You will end up coding in a language that you don't understand
- You are limited to how the framework acts. No room for modification.
- People can create their own framework based on the good parts of an existing one. Causing too much framework to be available


#### Why focus on Native JS
JS framework are made due to trends. People are free to make a framework work anything. This causes confusion on what framework is the best, what we should focus on and which one will be deprecated in a few years. It is good to know some frameworks for faster development, but don't get to fond of it

### Pro's and Con's of single page web app

#### Pro's

- Easy to re-use the code for mobile development, because it uses the same backend code.
- Can save things in the cache for speed


#### Con's
- JS has to be enabled
- Only one entry
- Page renders faster if you click the back button. Developers have to mimic the speed of traditional pages.
- Lower Search engine ranking
- Huge apps require a huge JS file which causes a slower browser
