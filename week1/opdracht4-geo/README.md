# Web app from scratch


### Pro's and Con's of libraries/frameworks

#### Pro's
- The functions in the framework are preprogrammed, which mean you as an user don't have to write them. This save time and lets you work on other stuff.
- Most known framework are used worldwide. This mean that the people who use it will come across issues and bugs. The framework will keep becoming better with the help of the contribution of these people.
- Most of the frameworks are free.

#### Con's
- You  might think you're learning javascript while using the javascript framework, but you will end up learning something that is abstract from javascript. You will have no idea what to do when a client asks for a vanilla javascript code.
- You are limited to how the framework acts and what is preprogrammed. No room for modification. If you want to modify a function you'll have to dive in the frameworks code, good luck understanding these complex code.
- People can create their own framework based on the good parts of an existing one. Causing too much framework to be available and mixed opinions on these frameworks


#### Why focus on Native JS
JS framework are made due to trends. People are free to make a framework of anything. This causes confusion on what framework is the best, what we should focus on and which one will be deprecated in a few years. It is good to know some frameworks for faster development, but don't get too attached of it.

### Pro's and Con's of single page web app

#### Pro's
- All the files and code for single page app will be loaded once no matter how many sections you have, while a regular web application may have to load all files every time a page loads.
- Most SPA are client side, which means code are rendered on the client-side. The backend can focus on other server demanding tasks. Regular web application have to render all pages on the server.


#### Con's
- JS has to be enabled for your app to work. If your users browser doesn't support javascript your app will not work.
- Page rendering will be different form regular webapps/websites because everything is on one page. A page will load faster if you click the back button. Developers have to mimic the speed of traditional pages.
- Lower Search engine ranking because everything is build via javascript. Google doesn't look there.
- Huge apps require a huge JS file which causes a slower browser.
