## About the app
Soundcloud explorer is a music search Single Page application (SPA) completely build with native Javascript. It uses the Soundcloud API to search songs and plays it on the page.
It was build as a three week project during a school Minor web-development. The main focus was to learn Object Oriented Programming Javascript.

## How does it work
This is a basic SPA that uses Javascript to get data from an API and navigate through the routes. A diagram and flowchart are drawn to illustrate how it works.

## Improving the app
Because it was a three week project there is still a lot that needs to be implemented.
Below is a list of features already in the app and a wishlist of features.
### Features
- Get a list of songs based on a search query.
- Listen to a song.
- Get information about a song.
- Login page that saves the username in the database (no database).
- The app checks existing routes and sends alerts if it doesn't exist.
- Pretty urls

### Wishlist
- A visible player that stays on screen while navigating through the pages.
- A personal page that keeps track of user-activities.
- Extend the app by adding multiple Music API.
- Group songs by categories.

### Contributing
You can help improve this app by sharing your expertise and tips, as well as learn from others. Contributions of all kinds are welcome: reporting issues, updating documentation, fixing bugs, building examples, sharing projects, and any other tips that may me improve my code.
