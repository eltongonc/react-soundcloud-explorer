# Web app from scratch
***
### intro
This week was all about data, routing and templating.
[research and restructuring of code](https://github.com/eltongonc/web_app_from_scratch/week1/opdracht4-geo)

## Single page app
During this week i also set up a basic Single Page App (SPA) structure. This SPA uses Object Literals and Immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE)
Student minimaal twee design patterns (in ieder geval Object Literal & IFFE) kan toepassen en uitleggen

#### Live demo
Here is a link to the [SPA](https://github.com/eltongonc/web_app_from_scratch/week1/opdracht5-spa)
